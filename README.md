## Statement

Yoshi's world is a game between two opponents in which each player controls a Yoshi (green or red) that moves like a horse on a chessboard. The tiles reached by each Yoshi are painted in his color and cannot be used by either player. The opponent can move again when his opponent has no more tiles available to move in. The game ends when neither player has any moves left to make. The winner of the game is the player who paints more tiles with his color.

There are three difficulties:

1. Normal: $2$ depth tree.

2. Medium: $4$ depth tree.

3. Difficult: $6$ depth tree.

> These are the maximum levels of the minimax tree.
